### Types of Cloud Computing

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  * Provide building blocks for cloud IT
  * Provides networking, computers, data storage space
  * Highest level of flexibility
  * Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
  
This is pretty much you building your own full application. With this support and maintainability falls back to the company.

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  * Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
  * Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
  
An example of this would be the internal Control-M or DBT by Fishtown tools we have at USAA. The underlying infrastructure and code is given to us by the vendor but we must deploy the new updates ourselves.
  
### Software as a Service (SaaS)
  * Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.
  
I don't believe at USAA we have many SaaS applications, we try to bring in as much of these tools as we can internally. 
I believe an example of SaaS is gitlab/github.
